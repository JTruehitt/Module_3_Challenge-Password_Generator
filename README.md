# Module 3 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description
In this challenge, we were tasked with writing the code for a password generator. This was our first major project utilizing javascript. The user must select a password between 8 and 128 characters, and they must also select at least one of four character types. The difficulty in this challenge was creating the logic and setting the loop functions to validate that the user was putting in the required information to generate an appropriate password. 

Through this challenge, I gained deeper knowledge of the following javascript principles:
- funcions
- declaring variables and variable hoisting
- if / else statements
- alert, confirm, prompt interactions
- while loops
- function recursion
- for loops
- event listeners
- minor DOM manipulation
